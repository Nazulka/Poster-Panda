## Structure

Detailed information can be found in the _Information Architecture_ section. 

## Skeleton 

- [x] **Desktop/Tablet and Mobile Wireframes**

* Wireframes were created using Balsamiq Wireframes at the planning stage of the project. 

* Some changes were made to the original wireframes during development process, particularly, I decided that only the Home page will feature a footer and all the rest of the pages (with the exception of the Products page) fit in one page for better user experience. Also, About, FAQs and Contact Us pages were not included in the project because it was considered low importance and low viability.

[Desktop/Tablet and Mobile Wireframes](https://github.com/Nazulka/Poster-Panda/blob/master/readme_docs/ms4-all-wireframes.pdf "Project wireframes created using Balsamiq")

## Surface

- [x] **Color Scheme**

![color palette](https://github.com/Nazulka/Poster-Panda/blob/master/readme_docs/coolors.png "Project color scheme palette from Coolors")

* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create the color palette for this project.
* Deeper shade of turquoise was chosen as a background color for the banner to support the Summer Collection images on the Home page and for some of the buttons. It is planned to change this banner's color every time when a new collection is out, so it fully complements the color scheme of the collection. 
* Light grey and black were used for the rest of the elements to keep it simple and less cluttered as product images can be quite colourful. 


- [x] **Typography**
* Google Fonts *Noto Sans* used accross the site for a harmonious look and feel.


- [x] **Imagery**
* All supporting images for the website as well as product images were carefully selected from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/home) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

- [x] **Requirements**

* *Python3* to write the code and run the application
* *PIP* to install packages
* *Git* for version control
* *GitPod* was used for this project 
* *Heroku* as a cloud based host platform
* *Stripe* as a secure payment processing platform.
* *AWS* cloud storage and S3 to store and retrieve media and static files.

- [x] **Project Creation**

* This project was created using the CI recommended Gitpod Full Template.
* Click on Use this template button and enter a short and memorable name of your choice for your repo and select Create repository from template.
* Once created, click on green Gitpod button to open your new workspace.


## Local Deployment


1.  Clone the project repository from GitHub
    * Go to the project [repository](https://github.com/Nazulka/Poster-Panda)
    * Click on the _Code_ button and Download ZIP. You can unzip the files in the directory of your choice.
    * Alternatively, you can run this command in your IDE:    
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/Nazulka/Poster-Panda.git
    ```
    * Copy the repository in your IDE.

2. To install Python required modules, run in the command line:

    ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

3. If Gitpod is used for development, these environmental variables can be stored in _Settings_ > _Variables_ on the Gitpod Workspaces page. 
``` 
'DEVELOPMENT', set to 'True'
'SECRET_KEY', '<your value - from Django Secret Key Generator>'
'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '<your value - API publishable key from Stripe dashboard>'
'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '<your value - API secret key from Stripe dashboard>'
'STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '<your value - from Stripe's developer API after creating a webhook>'
```

4. To set up the local database, run:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate 
```

5. Create a superuser to access Django admin panel:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the server:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

[:top:](#poster-panda)

## Remote Deployment


1. Create an account in [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) if you haven't got it already and log in. Create a new app, give it a unique name and select the region closest to you.
![Heroku app](./readme_docs/heroku-app.png)

2. On the _Resources_ tab provision a new **Postgres** database. 

3. To use Postgres, go back to Gitpod and install:
```
pip3 install dj_database_url
pip3 install psycopg2-binary
```

4. Freeze the requirements:
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

5. To set up the new database:

* Go to _settings.py_ and 
``` 
import dj_databas_url
```

* Then comment out the default _SQLite_ database and replace it with _Postgres SQL_. Your URL link can be obtained by revealing _Config Vars_ in Heroku _Settings_. 
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-url')
```

6. Apply all migrations to get the _Postgres SQL_ database set up.
``` 
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
7. To import the product data, load categories first and then products, as products depend on categories.
``` 
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
8. Create superuser:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
9. Install _gunicorn_ to act as a webserver and update the requirements:
``` 
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

10. Create a _Procfile_ to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run gunicorn and serve our django app. 
```
web: gunicorn your-app-name.wsgi:application
```

11. Add, commit the changes and push them to GitHub and then to Heroku master. Make sure you are logged in to Heroku from your CLI.

12. In Heroku, go to your app, under -Deploy_ tab select _Connect to GitHub_ then find and connect to your repository. Click on _Enable automatic deploys_ so any changes pushed to GitHub can be automatically deployed to Heroku and finally 'Deploy Branch'.  

13. Reveal Config Vars in _Settings_ to add environmental variables. 
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
DATABASE_URL
SECRET_KEY
USE_AWS
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_WH_SECRET
```
Remember,they should match the ones you have in your _settings.py_ file.
